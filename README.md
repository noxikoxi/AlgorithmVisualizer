# Algorithm Visualizer

### Algorithm Visualizer is a web app that allows you to learn algorithms and data structures providing visualization supporting your imagination on how different things works.

### App is live on https://algorithmvisualizer-vqlt.onrender.com

### Currently only sorting algorithms are implemented, however many more are planned.

## Features
- Main feature is interactive visualization of popular algorithms
- In addition, learning about algorithms is possible, because each one has description and code

## Technologies
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Typescript**
- **React**

## Future Plans
- Extend the application to visualize other algorithms (e.g. graph algorithms)
- More coding languages to choose from when learning about algorithms
- Extend the application to visualize data structures (e.g. stack, queue, list)
- Constantly improving UI and UX
- Constantly updating home page with available functionality
